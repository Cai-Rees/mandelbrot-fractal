# mandelbrot-fractal
A short project I set out on after becoming interested in aspects of chaotic and fractal behaviour. 

The purpose of this code is to compute and plot the mandelbrot set. This is a mathematical set of numbers in the complex plane, which forms a infintely complex fractal boundary with the complex numbers outside the set. The set is defined using the following iterative formula:

    $$Z_{n+1} = Z_{n}^{2} + Z_{0}$$
